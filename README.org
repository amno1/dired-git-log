* Dired Git Log

Display git information inside a dired buffer:

This started as a fork of Clemera's [[dired-git-info][https://github.com/clemera/dired-git-info]],
because I needed a version without overlayes, that works with my
dired-auto-readme and mode dired-hacks. It is now totally reworked to use text
properties as well as how it works internally. I would also like to
turn it into async (non-blocking) version, but it is not implemented yet.

* Installation
  
  This is not yet in either Elpa nor Melpa, so currently you will have to
  install it manually.

** Manual

For manual installation, clone the repository and call:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package-install-file "/path/to/dired-git-log.el")
#+END_SRC

* Config

** Bind the minor mode command in dired

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (define-key dired-mode-map ")" 'dired-git-log-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Don't hide normal Dired file info

By default, toggling =dired-git-log-mode= also toggles the built-in
=dired-hide-details-mode=, which hides file details such as ownership,
permissions and size. This behaviour can be disabled by overriding
=dgi-auto-hide-details-p=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq dired-git-log-auto-hide-details-p nil)
#+END_SRC

** Enable automatically in every Dired buffer (if in Git repository)

To enable =dired-git-info-mode= whenever you navigate to a Git repository, use
the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'dired-after-readin-hook 'dired-git-log-auto-enable)
#+END_SRC
